Euclidean distance

The script parses an ad hoc binary file with millions of points (one coordinate per line) 
and calculates the squared of the Euclidean distance of the points in the file to 
two chosen fixed ones. 

The 10 ones nearest to a point and 20 furthest from the other one are then selected.
